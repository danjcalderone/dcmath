        <b> CONVEX COMBINATIONS </b>

        <p>
        One specific type of linear combination that often arises is a convex combination.

        A convex combination of vectors is formed when we require the coefficients of a linear combination
        to all be positive and sum to one, ie.
        $$
        A_1 x_1 + A_2 x_2 + \cdots + A_n x_n
        $$
        with
        $$
        \sum_i x_i = 1, \qquad x_i \geq 0
        $$
        Note that we also write this in a compact notation as
        $$
        \mathbf{1}^Tx = 1, \qquad x \geq 0
        $$
        or even more simply we say that \(x\) live on a simplex \(x \in \Delta_n \).
        Visually, a convex combination of vectors live in the space between the vectors. For
        any two vectors \(A_1\) and \(A_2\), \(A_1 \tfrac{1}{2} + A_2 \tfrac{1}{2}\)
        is the vector halfway between the two vectors; for \(n\) vectors \(\sum_i A_i \tfrac{1}{n}\)
        is the center of the set of vectors ("average" vector of the set); etc.
        Different convex combinations of vectors \(\big\{A_1,A_2,A_3\big\} \in \mathbb{R}^3\)
        are illustrated in the figures below.

        <div class="txt" style="padding:40px">

        <p>
        A convex combination between just two vectors is often written in the form
        $$
        y = A_1 (1-\alpha) + A_2\alpha
        $$
        with \(0 \leq \alpha \leq 1 \).  We notice that if we start out with \(\alpha = 0\),
        \(y=A_1\).   We note that we can rearrange the above expression to show explicitly how
        \(y\) changes with \(\alpha\)
        $$
        y = A_1 + (A_2-A_1)\alpha
        $$
        As \alpha moves from 0 to 1, \(y\) starts at \(A_1\) and then adds back little bits of the difference
        from \(A_1\) to \(A_2\) until \(y\) reaches \(A_2\).
        This perspective is illustrated in the figure below.
      </p>
    </div>

      <div class="txt" style="padding:40px">
      <p>
      Keeping \(\alpha\) between 0  and 1 keeps \(y\) on the segment between \(A_1\) and \(A_2\).
      If we relax this condition and allow \(\alpha\) to be negative or greater than 1,
      we trace out a whole line that runs through \(A_1\) and \(A_2\).
      \(\alpha<0 \) extends past \(A_1\); \(\alpha > 1\) extends off past \(A_2\).

      Note that here \(x_1 = (1-\alpha)\) and \(x_2 = \alpha\).  Removing the restriction
      on \(\alpha\) is equivalent to removing the restriction that \(x_1 \geq 0\) and
      \(x_2 \geq 0\).  By construction, we still have \(x_1 + x_2 = (1-\alpha) + \alpha = 1 \)

      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="txt" style="padding:40px">
    <p>
    Note that this extension to the line through \(A_1\) and \(A_2\) implies to
    larger numbers of vectors as well.  For example for three vectors \(\big\{A_1,A_2,A_3 \big\}\),
    removing the restriction that \(x\geq 0 \) expands the convex set to the plane shown below.
    Note that signs of \(x_1\),\(x_2\), and \(x_3\) in each part of the plane.

  <b> More Math: Is a Point Inside a Triangle (Difficulty: 4/10) </b>
  <p>
  The above construction can be quite useful for determining
  quickly if a point is inside a triangle, tetrahedron, or hyper-tetrahedron.
  (This has many applications. For example it is a critical step in the implementation
  of the quickhull algorithm for computing convex hulls of points.) We focus on the
  case of three points in 2D, ie. determining if a point is inside a triangle.
  </p>
  <p>
  To determine if a point \(y \in \mathbb{R}^2\) is inside a triangle formed by points
  \(\big{A_1,A_2,A_3\big} \subset \mathbb{R}^2\), we can form the following system of equations
  $$
  \begin{bmatrix}
  y \\ 1
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \underbrace{
  \begin{bmatrix}
  \begin{matrix}
  | & | & | \\
  A_1 & A_2 &  A_3 \\
  | & | & | \\
  \end{matrix} \\
  \begin{matrix}
  - & \mathbf{1}^T & -
  \end{matrix}
  \end{bmatrix}
  }_{M}
  \begin{bmatrix}
  x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
  The last row this system of equations requires \(x\) to sum to 1, ie. \(x\) generates
  linear combinations in the plane shown in the figure above.
  The first two rows then say that \(y\) is a linear combination of the
  \(A_i\) vectors.  Note assuming this system is invertible, we can compute \(x=M^{-1}y\).
  After computing \(x\) one can immediately read off which section of the plane \(y\) is
  in based on the signs of the elements of \(x\).  If \(x\geq 0\), then \(y\) is in the
  triangle. For fast implementation a \(3\times 3\) matrix \(M\) can be inverted explicitly
    (see inverse formulas).
  </p>


  <p>
  Note: this system will always be invertible unless the triangle shown above collapse
  to a line and the problem is ill-posed.  One could still actually take the pseudo-inverse
  which would determine if the projection of \(y\) onto that line was inside the
  convex combination of the points.  (I think.)

  <b> More Math: Coordinate Transformations on Convex Hulls (Difficulty: 4/10) </b>
  <p>
  When we're working with a convex hull of a set of points,
  we may often want to write different coordinate systems based on those points.
  We list several useful coordinate transformations below along with explicit
  representations of their inverses, diagrams, and intuitive explanations.  Of course,
  other useful transformations are possible.
