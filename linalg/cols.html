      <b> COLUMN & ROW GEOMETRY </b>

      <p>
        When we define a matrix, we define both columns and rows of the matrix.
        When we think about the geometry of a linear transformation sometimes
        we focuse on a matrix as a set of columns and sometimes we think of it as
        a set of rows.  These column and row geometries can both be fruitful perspectives
        and we give more details on each below.
      </p>
      <p>
        We note that for this discussion we are assuming that a matrix \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\)
        operators on a column vector \(x \in \mathbb{R}^n \) by left multiplying, \(Ax\).
        All the intuition we develop would be flipped if we were primarily considering
        right multiplying row vectors by the matrix \(A\).
      </p>


      <b> COLUMN GEOMETRY </b>
      <p>
      The column geometry of a matrix is probably the most natural and we have already
      expounded on it in detail in our previous discussion of linear combinations.
      When visualizing the column geometry, we represent each columns of a matrix \(A_1, \dots, A_n\)
      as a vector in the co-domain.  Each of these columns defines where a given standard basis vector
      \(I_1,\dots,I_n\) maps to under the transformation and this in turn defines how the whole space
      transforms.  When we multiply a vector \(x\) by \(A\), \(x\) defines a linear combination of
      the columns of \(A\) as previously discussed.  This picture is continually useful in analysis.
      We note that from this picture we can easily visualize the subsapce in the
      co-domain spanned by the columns.  This is known as the range.
      Though it is slightly more complicated, we can also use this geometry
      to visualize the nullspace of \(A\), ie. the subspace of vectors \(x\) in the domain such that \(Ax =0\).
      We will discuss these more later.
      </p>
      <p>
      The column geometry is quite direct as it shows where each coordinate of \(x\) maps to directly. As we
      will see next the row geometry is more subtle.
      </p>


      <b> ROW GEOMETRY </b>
      <p>
      The row geometry of a matrix is less direct than the column geometry and thus
      requires more thought in visualization.  We first note that multiplying \(x\) by \(A\)
      can be thought of as taking the inner product of \(x\) with each row of \(A\).
      (See the rules of block matrix multiplication for further details.)

      $$
      Ax =
      \begin{bmatrix}
      - & \bar{A}_1^T &  - \\
      & \vdots & \\
      - & \bar{A}_n^T &  - \\
      \end{bmatrix}
      \begin{bmatrix}
      | \\
      x \\
      |
      \end{bmatrix}
      =
      \begin{bmatrix}
      \bar{A}_1^Tx\\
      \vdots \\
      \bar{A}_n^T
      \end{bmatrix}
      $$

      Up to a point, we can use this to visualize the action of a matrix by thinking loosely of
      each element of the product \(Ax\) as the projection of \(x\) onto that row.
      This is most diretly accurate if the rows of \(A\) each have unit norm as visualized in the
      image below.
    </p>
  </div>

      <p>
        If the rows don't have unit norm, this visualization idea is best applied when \(x\)
        is confined to the unit ball, ie. when we simply think about the direction of \(x\).
        The output element in the co-domain for a unit direction \(x\) is then given by
        projecting each row onto \(x\) as visualized below.
      </p>

        We can visualize the action of a matrix (ie. a linear transformation)
        from many angles.  Two basic angles are to visualize the columns of
        the matrix and the rows of a matrix.  of the most basic are to visualize the geometry
        of the columns of the matrix and
