            <b> VECTORS</b>
            <p>

            The Cartesian representation of a nD vector is a string of \(n\) numbers that each
            represent a distance in a different direction/dimension.  These directions are often referred to as "axes".
            $$
            x = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_n \end{bmatrix}
            $$
            Vectors can be "scaled" by multiplying each element by a value \(\alpha\) and two vectors \(x\) and \(z\) can be added
            element-wise (assuming they have the same length).

            $$
             x\alpha = \begin{bmatrix} \alpha x_1 \\ \vdots \\ \alpha x_n \end{bmatrix},
            \qquad
            x + z = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_n \end{bmatrix}
            + \begin{bmatrix} z_1 \\ \vdots \\ z_n \end{bmatrix} =
            \begin{bmatrix} x_1+z_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_n+z_n \end{bmatrix}
            $$
            </p>




            <b> AXES </b>
            <p>
            The different directions or axes that make up a vector (scaled to have unit length) can be represented by
            the so-called "standard basis".
            $$
            I_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \end{bmatrix},
            \quad
            I_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \end{bmatrix},
            \quad
            \cdots
            \quad
            I_n = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 1 \end{bmatrix},
            $$
            </p>

            <b> Drawing Vectors </b>

            <b> Perpendicular Axes and 2D Representations </b>

            </p>
            Traditionally, these axes are pictures as perpendicular to each other.
            For visualization since we're limited to drawing in 2 dimensions, the best we can do is to pick directions (in 2D) for each
            of these axes to point.  The overall vector position of the vector \(x\) is then the sum of each axis scaled by the appropriate
            element of \(x\).

            $$
            x = I_1 x_1 + \cdots + I_n x_n
            $$

            $$
            x =
             \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} x_1 +
             \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} x_2
             +
             \cdots
             +
             \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} x_n
            $$


            This depiction does not lose any information for 2D vectors.  For 3D vectors, there is a depth direction (towards the viewer)
            that is lost in the drawing.  Since we live in 3D, we are used to this and can often spatially reconstruct that lost direciton in
            our mental representation of the vector.  For 4D vectors, the depth "direction" becomes a plane; for 5D vectors, depth is
            a 3D space; for 6D vectors, depth is 4D space, etc.  Our 2D representations of these higher dimensional spaces lose quite
            a bit of information that is difficult for us to reconstruct but the 2D representations can still sometimes be useful.

            </p>


            <b> Parallel Axes Representations </b>

            <p>
            We can also visualize vectors using axes that are parallel to each other.  In these settings, a vector can be thought of
            as a set of heights (possibly negative).   This representation does not suffer from the concept of depth but that's simply
            because it does not attempt to leverage our spatial reasoning machinery for intuition.  Both representations can be useful
            depending on context

            <b> Scaling, Adding, and Subtracting  </b>
            <p>
            "Scaling" \(x\) by a number \(\lambda\) involves multiplying each element in \(x\) by \(\lambda\).
            Visually (for perpendicular axes) this expands or shrinks \(x\) without changing the orientation of the vector.
            When \(lambda\) is negative, the direction of the vector flips and points in the opposite direction.
            For parallel axes, this increases, shrinks, and/or flips the heights of each element by a the same value (\(\lambda\)).
            </p>

            <p>
            Adding vectors is done elementwise.  Visually (for perpendicular axes), this sum is a new vector given by placing the two vectors "tip-to-tail."
            For parallel axes, we simply "stack" the heights together to get the height of the new vector.
            </p>

            <p>
            Adding multiple vectors is illustrated below in 2D and in 3D

                  Subtraction between two vectors is also done element-wise.

                  weights \(1\) and \(-1\).  -->
                  If we think of the vector as floating rather
                  than attached to the origin, the difference vector points from the end of
                  one vector to the other.

          <!-- <p>

            Scaling multiple vectors \(x^1,\dots,x^n\) and then adding them together is referred to as
            taking a "linear combination" of the vectors.  All the possible linear combinations of a set of vectors
            is called the "span" of those vectors.  If a set of vectors span a whole space that means
            any vector in that space can be written as a linear combination of those vectors.
