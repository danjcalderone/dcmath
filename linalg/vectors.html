            <b> VECTORS</b>
            <p>

            The Cartesian representation of a nD vector is a string of \(n\) numbers that each
            represent a distance in a different direction/dimension.  These directions are often referred to as "axes".
            $$
            x = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_n \end{bmatrix}
            $$
            Vectors can be "scaled" by multiplying each element by a value \(\alpha\) and two vectors \(x\) and \(z\) can be added
            element-wise (assuming they have the same length).

            $$
             x\alpha = \begin{bmatrix} \alpha x_1 \\ \vdots \\ \alpha x_n \end{bmatrix},
            \qquad
            x + z = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_n \end{bmatrix}
            + \begin{bmatrix} z_1 \\ \vdots \\ z_n \end{bmatrix} =
            \begin{bmatrix} x_1+z_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_n+z_n \end{bmatrix}
            $$
            </p>




            <b> AXES </b>
            <p>
            The different directions or axes that make up a vector (scaled to have unit length) can be represented by
            the so-called "standard basis" vectors (more explanation of this name later).
            $$
            I_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \end{bmatrix},
            \quad
            I_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \end{bmatrix},
            \quad
            \cdots
            \quad
            I_n = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 1 \end{bmatrix},
            $$
            </p>

            <b> Drawing Vectors </b>



            </p>
            Traditionally, axes are thought of as perpendicular to each other.
            The overall vector position of the vector \(x\) is then the sum of each axis scaled by the appropriate
            element of \(x\).

            $$
            x = I_1 x_1 + \cdots + I_n x_n
            $$

            $$
            x =
             \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} x_1 +
             \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} x_2
             +
             \cdots
             +
             \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} x_n
             =
             \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}+
             \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
             +
             \cdots
             +
             \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ x_n \end{bmatrix}
             =
             \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_n \end{bmatrix}
            $$
            We can also visualize vectors using axes that are parallel to each other.  In these settings, a vector can be thought of
            as a set of heights (possibly negative).  These two depictions are shown below.

            <b> The Problem of Depth </b>
            <p>
            When trying to visualize perpendicular axes, we run into a problem.
            Since we can only draw in two dimensions, there are not enough perpendicular directions for all the axes for vectors of dimension three or higher.
            The best we can do is to pick directions (in the 2D image) for each of these axes to point and think of them as being perpendicular in some higher dimensional space.
            Our drawing then becomes a 2D projection of that higher dimensional space.
            This depiction does not lose any information for 2D vectors, but for 3D vectors, there is a depth direction (towards the viewer)
            that is lost in the drawing.  Since we live in 3D, we are used to this and can often spatially reconstruct that lost direction in
            our mental representation of the vector.  For 4D vectors, the depth "direction" becomes a plane; for 5D vectors, depth becomes a
            3D space; for 6D vectors, depth becomes a 4D space, etc, and our drawing loses quite a bit of information and our intuition suffers accordingly.
            If you enjoy spatial reasoning, these 2D representations of higher dimensional vectors can still be useful, but you should be careful
            not to forget the information lost in the projection.
            </p>
            <p>
            Representing axes in parallel does not suffer from this pathology of depth, but that's simply
            because this represnetation does not attempt to leverage our spatial reasoning machinery for intuition.
            </p>



            <b> More Intuition: Depth </b>
            <p>
              For more intuition about the idea of depth in 2D representations of higher dimensional spaces,
              play around with the following visualizations of higher dimensional shapes.  In particular,
              the jump from 3D to 4D (and then maybe 5D) can be illuminating.

            <b> More Math: Projection to 2D (Difficulty: 3/10) </b>
            <p>
              The projection from an \(n\)D space to a 2D image can be represented by the matrix multiplication \(y=Ax\) where
              \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{2 \times n} \)

              $$
              \begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\ y_2 \end{bmatrix} =
              \begin{bmatrix}
              A_{11} & A_{12} & \cdots & A_{1n} \\
              A_{21} & A_{22} & \cdots & A_{2n}
              \end{bmatrix} =
              \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_n \end{bmatrix}
              $$

              Here \(x \in \mathbb{R}^n\) is the coordinates of the vector in \(n\)D.
              Each column of the \(n\) columns of \(A\) is the representation of one of the \(n\) axes in the 2D drawing
              and \(y \in \mathbb{R}^2 \) is the 2D projection of the vector \(x\).  The depth directions (in the \(n\)D space)
              are given by the nullspace of the matrix \(A\).  The rank-nullity theorem then gives that depth has the dimension \(n-2\)

            <b> Scaling, Adding, and Subtracting  </b>
            <p>
            "Scaling" \(x\) by a number \(\lambda\) involves multiplying each element in \(x\) by \(\lambda\).
            Visually (for perpendicular axes) this expands or shrinks \(x\) without changing the orientation of the vector.
            When \(lambda\) is negative, the direction of the vector flips and points in the opposite direction.
            For parallel axes, this increases, shrinks, and/or flips the heights of each element by a the same value (\(\lambda\)).
            </p>

            <p>
            Adding vectors is done elementwise.  Visually (for perpendicular axes), this sum is a new vector given by placing the two vectors "tip-to-tail."
            For parallel axes, we simply "stack" the heights together to get the height of the new vector.
            </p>

            <p>
            Adding multiple vectors is illustrated below in 2D and in 3D

                  Subtraction between two vectors is also done element-wise.
                  <!-- It couldalso be thought of as taking a linear combination of two vectors with
                  weights \(1\) and \(-1\).  -->
                  If we think of the vector as floating rather
                  than attached to the origin, the difference vector points from the end of
                  one vector to the other.

          <!-- <p>

            Scaling multiple vectors \(x^1,\dots,x^n\) and then adding them together is referred to as
            taking a "linear combination" of the vectors.  All the possible linear combinations of a set of vectors
            is called the "span" of those vectors.  If a set of vectors span a whole space that means
            any vector in that space can be written as a linear combination of those vectors.
