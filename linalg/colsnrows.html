      <b> COLUMN & ROW GEOMETRY </b>

      <p>
        When we define a matrix, we define both columns and rows of the matrix.
        When we think about the geometry of a linear transformation sometimes
        we focuse on a matrix as a set of columns and sometimes we think of it as
        a set of rows.  These column and row geometries can both be fruitful perspectives
        and we give more details on each below.
      </p>

      <p>
        We note that for this discussion we are assuming that a matrix \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\)
        operators on a column vector \(x \in \mathbb{R}^n \) by left multiplying, \(Ax\).
        All the intuition we develop would be flipped if we were primarily considering
        right multiplying row vectors by the matrix \(A\).
      </p>


      <b> COLUMN GEOMETRY </b>
      <p>
      The column geometry of a matrix is probably the most natural and we have already
      expounded on it in detail in our previous discussion of linear combinations.
      When visualizing the column geometry, we represent each columns of a matrix \(A_1, \dots, A_n\)
      as a vector in the co-domain.  Each of these columns defines where a given standard basis vector
      \(I_1,\dots,I_n\) maps to under the transformation and this in turn defines how the whole space
      transforms.  When we multiply a vector \(x\) by \(A\), \(x\) defines a linear combination of
      the columns of \(A\) as previously discussed.  This picture is continually useful in analysis.
      We note that from this picture we can easily visualize the subsapce in the
      co-domain spanned by the columns.  This is known as the range.
      Though it is slightly more complicated, we can also use this geometry
      to visualize the nullspace of \(A\), ie. the subspace of vectors \(x\) in the domain such that \(Ax =0\).
      We will discuss these more later.

    <div class="txt" style="padding:40px">
      <p>
      The column geometry is quite direct as it shows where each coordinate of \(x\) maps to directly. As we
      will see next the row geometry is more subtle.

      <b> ROW GEOMETRY </b>
      <p>
      The row geometry of a matrix is less direct than the column geometry and thus
      requires more thought in visualization.  We first note that multiplying \(x\) by \(A\)
      can be thought of as taking the inner product of \(x\) with each row of \(A\).
      (See the rules of block matrix multiplication for further details.)

      $$
      Ax =
      \begin{bmatrix}
      - & \bar{A}_1^T &  - \\
      & \vdots & \\
      - & \bar{A}_n^T &  - \\
      \end{bmatrix}
      \begin{bmatrix}
      | \\
      x \\
      |
      \end{bmatrix}
      =
      \begin{bmatrix}
      \bar{A}_1^Tx\\
      \vdots \\
      \bar{A}_n^T
      \end{bmatrix}
      $$

      Up to a point, we can use this to visualize the action of a matrix by thinking loosely of
      each element of the product \(Ax\) as the projection of \(x\) onto that row.
      This projection is best applied when \(x\)
        is confined to the unit ball, ie. when we think about \(x\) as a pure direction.
        The output element in the co-domain for a unit direction \(x\) is then given by
        projecting each row onto \(x\) as visualized below.  Note that the longer the
        rows the increase in length in the output coordinate in the co-domain. We can
        extend this construction by then scaling each element of the resulting vector
        by the length of \(x\).  This visualization method is not as clean as the
        column generation method since it suffers from sum of the difficulties of
        visualizating inner products in general when either of the vectors are not unit
        vectors.

        A perhaps more insightful way to visualize row geometry is to think of
        directions that are orthogonal to a particular row.  A column (drawn in
        the co-domain) clearly defines where a standard basis vector in the domain
        maps to (both in terms of direction and length).
        A row (drawn in the domain) most clearly defines an
        \(n-1\) dimensional subspace that is the preimage of the plane
        where that particular coordinate is 0 in the co-domain (or 0-plane).
        Note that this is purely based on the direction of the row.
        The length of the row gives the size of that particular output coordinate
        but in a slightly more subtle way (to be discussed).
        To see the pre-image of a particular axis in the co-domain
        we have to visualize the intersection of the 0-planes associated with all
        the other rows.  This shows us the pre-image of the axis direction.
        (Length of vectors in this preimage are a little more subtle.)
        A unit vector in this direction (in the domain) is mapped to a vector
        (on the axis in the co-domain) with a length given by the projection of
        of the row onto that unit vector.  All of this is visualized in the image below.

                <!-- By squinting our eyes even more, we can now extend this visualization to general \(x\).
        No matter the size of \(x\), we first project the rows of \(A\) onto the
        direction of \(x\) to get the general shape of the output vector \(y\).
        Since we've ignored the length of \(x\) what we are actually visualizing
        is \(y/\vert| v\vert|_2\).  We can then scale this result by \(\vert|x\vert|_2\)
        to get the actual value of \(y\).  Note that this is the same stretching for each
        element so it is not difficult to visualize.
        This method suffers from some of the same pathologies as visualizing
        inner products in general but in some cases the ideas can be servicable. -->
