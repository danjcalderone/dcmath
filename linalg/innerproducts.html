              <b> INNER PRODUCTS  </b>
              <p>

              Vectors contain both the notion of length and direction.
              While magnitude is a property that vectors share with regular numbers,
              direction is a uniquely vector property.

              As such we can talk about the relative magnitude of two vectors
              and we can also talk about whether or not they point in similar directions,
              opposite directions or whether they are "perpendicular"
              or "orthogonal" to each other.  The "inner product" or "dot product"
              of two vectors is at the heart of this direction comparison.
              </p>


              <b> Definition </b>
                  <p>
                    The inner product, denoted by \(\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle\),
                    between two vectors \(x, y \in \mathbb{R}^n\) is given by
                    $$
                    \langle y,x \rangle = \sum_i y_ix_i
                    $$
                    We can also write the inner product in several other ways.
                    $$
                    \langle y,x \rangle = \sum_i y_ix_i = y^Tx = \lVert y \rVert_2  \lVert x \rVert_2 \cos(\theta)
                    $$
                    The expression \(y^Tx\) uses matrix multiplication notation;
                    \(y^T\) is a row vector and \(x\) as a column vector.
                    (This expression is perhaps the most clean and useful algebraically.)
                    The final expression \(\lVert y \rVert \lVert x \rVert_2 \cos(\theta)\)
                    is the geometric definition of an inner product that we will consider more below.
                    \(\lVert y \rVert_2\) and \(\lVert x \rVert_2\) are the magnitudes of
                    \(x\) and \(y\) and \(\theta\) is the angle between the two vectors.

                  </p>

                <b> Geometry of Inner Products </b>


                <p>
                  The geometry of the inner product can be seen by considering
                  the law of cosines (an extension of the Pythagorean theorem)
                  detailed in the image below.
                </p>
              </div>

                </div>


                <div class="txt" style="padding:40px">
                <p>
                  Note that the law of cosines is an extension of the Pythagorean
                  theorem in that it gives a correction term for when \(\theta \neq \pi/2\).
                  This correction term is closely related to the inner product between
                  the vectors that form the sides of the triangle.
                  Consider the norm (squared) of the vector difference \(x-y\)
                  $$
                  (x-y)^T(x-y) = x^Tx + y^Ty - 2y^Tx
                  $$
                  The law of cosines gives that the last term can be expressed as
                  $$
                  2y^Tx = 2 \lVert y \rVert_2  \lVert x \rVert_2 \cos(\theta)
                  $$
                  which gives the geometric interpretation of the inner product.
                  Note from this definition if two vectors \(x\) and \(y\) point in
                  similar directions (small \(\theta\)) then \(y^Tx\) will be larger;
                  if they are perpendicular (\(\theta=\pi/2\)) then \(y^Tx = 0\)
                  and if they point in opposite directions (\(\theta\) closer to \(\pi\)) then
                  \(y^Tx\) will be negative.
                  The inner product is closely related to length of one vector after it
                  is projected onto another.  Specifically if \(y\) is a unit vector,
                  then \(y^Tx\) is exactly the length of \(x\) after it is projected
                  onto \(y\) as shown in the image below.

              <b> Visualizing Scalar Multiplication </b>


              <p>
              To better visualize the geometry of the inner product, we first
              consider scalar multiplication of two real numbers in the following way.
              For the product of any two real numbers \(x,y \in \mathbb{R}\),
              we can think of \(x\) as a step-size and \(y\) as how many steps we take
              (not necessarily an integer).  On a number line,
              We can think of this as re-defining a unit for \(y\) as \(x\).
              Visually this is equivalent to dragging the value of 1 on the \(y\)
              number line to the value of \(x\) and allowing \(y\) to be stretched as well.

              As 1 goes to \(x\), \(y\) will go to \(xy\).

              If \(x\) is greater than 1, \(y\) gets stretched away from the origin;
              if \(x\) is less than one then \(y\) gets shrunk toward the origin.
              If the sign of \(x\) is negative then \(y\) also gets flipped to
              the otherside of the numberline.
              The value \(x=1\) is special in that it leaves \(y\) unchanged and \(x=-1\)
              leaves the magnitude of \(y\) unchanged but just flips
              the side of the numberline.  We can illustrate this property in the figure below.

          <b> Visualizing Inner Products </b>


          <p>
          If we consider the product of the magnitudes of two vectors \(x\) and \(y\)
          (\(\lVert y \rVert_2  \lVert x \rVert_2\)),
          the above intuition for scalar multiplication carries over if we think radial, ie.
          in terms of distance from the origin.  Considering the angle \(\theta\)
          (\(\lVert y \rVert_2  \lVert x \rVert_2\)\cos(\theta)\))
          adds in the step of projecting the product onto the direction of the \(x\) vector.
          For a fixed angle, \(\theta\) we then get the visualization shown below.

          <p>
            As was noted above, unlike scalars, vectors contain both the notion of length and direction.
            If a scalar has some notion of direction it is simply a binary value \(\pm 1\),
            ie. is the number positive or negative.  This "direction" determines whether
            or not multiplying by this number flips the direction of another number.
            Inner products can be thought of as expanding this binary value of \( \pm 1\)
            to a full \(360^o\) of relative orientation.  Rather than simply
            flipping the sign of the vector product based on the directions of the vectors,
            inner product compares their relative direction and then multiplies by a
            number in the interval \([-1,1]\) given by \(\cos(\theta)\)

            <p>
            Another perspective on the inner product \(y^Tx\)
            (perhaps closer to the notion of matrix multiplication)
            is to think of the row vector \(y^T\) as a set of columns (each of length)
            one and then \(x\) as a set of coordinates.  We can then visualize the inner product in the following way.

          <b> ORTHOGONALITY  </b>
          <p>


          One of the fundamental notions associated with inner products is the idea
          of orthogonality.  Two vectors are orthogonal if they are perpendicular, ie.
          the angle between them is \(\theta = \tfrac{\pi}{2}\).  Intuitivley, if two vectors are orthogonal
          they represent entirely separate directions that do not affect each other, ie. the projection of one vector
          onto the other is 0.  For a vector \(x \in \mathbb{R}^n\), the set of vectors orthogonal to \(x\) has
          dimension \(n-1\).  Subspaces are often defined as being orthogonal to some vector or set of vectors
          (see the discussion of nullspaces).

          </p>
          <p> Perpendicular vectors in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) and \(\mathbb{R}^3\) are pictured below.  </p>

          <b> Inner Products and Quadratic Forms </b>


          <p> Note: this section is better understood with background in positive
          definite matrices.
          </p>


          <p>

          We can generalize the Euclidean inner product with a positive definite symmetric
          matrix \(P \succ 0\), \(P=P^T \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\)
          to get the \(P\)-inner product defined as

          $$
          \langle y,x \rangle_P =
          \Vert x \Vert_P = y^TPx
          $$
          Rather than a uniform, spherical geometry, this inner product induces an ellipsoidal geometry.
          One interpretation of this inner product is that each vector \(x\) and \(y\) is transformed (stretched) using the coordinate
          transfromations \(x' = P^{\tfrac{1}{2}}x\) and \(y'=P^{\tfrac{1}{2}}y\)
          before the regular Euclidean inner product is applied.

          Note that for the \(P\)-inner product, orthogonality, ie. \(y^TPx= 0\), does
          not imply that the angle between the two vectors is \(90^o\).  Graphically,
          orthogonality is better understood as one vector being parallel
          to a tangent vector where the other vector crosses the unit ball.
          This is illustrated below and discussed more in the section on orthogonality.
