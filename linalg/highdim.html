          <b> HIGH DIMENSIONAL VECTOR DIRECTIONS (Difficulty: 5/10)</b>
          <p>
          In higher (10+) dimensions, ordinary spatial intuition for vectors
          breaks down and only parallel axis representations are possible.
          As discussed previously unit vectors in high dimensions have somewhat
          counter-intuitive forms.  We show a parallel axis representation
          for unit vectors in eight and sixteen dimensions below. Note that only
          a few elements of each vector can be substantively larger than 0 at any
          time.

        <div class="txt" style="padding:40px">
          <p>
            In low dimensions with a spatial representation of vectors, we can easily
            see when two vectors line up or point in opposite directions or are perpendicular.

          In order to "see" orthogonality and correlation between
          vectors in a parallel axis representation (in low or high dimensions)
          we must develop a different set of intuition.  To this end,
          we first represent two high dimensional vectors \(x\)
          and \(y\)
          $$
          \begin{bmatrix} x_1 & \cdots & x_n \end{bmatrix}, \qquad
          \begin{bmatrix} y_1 & \cdots & y_n \end{bmatrix},
          $$
          as points along two separate axes.  This is a parallel
          axis representation for each vector - with the directions of variation drawn
          perpendicular to each other.  We can then visualize the values in the \(i\)th
          dimension as a point  \((x_i, y_i)\) in a 2D plane.  Again note here that
          the dimensions of the vectors is the number of points and the 2D plane
          represents the fact we have two vectors.
          To isolate the directionality of the
          vectors assume both \(x\) and \(y\) are unit vectors. (If the vectors
          are not unit vectors originally, we can simply think of scaling the axes
          so that the vectors are inside the unit ball.
          We now borrow some ideas from statistics and data fitting
          for intuition.
        </p>

        <b> Intuition from Least Squares </b>
        <p>
          We first consider the simple linear model
          $$
          y_i = m x_i, \qquad i=1,\dots,n
          $$
          with slope \(m\) and 0 vertical intercept.
          From the data cloud of points \((x_i,y_i)\), we can easily intuitively see what the
          best fit slope \(m\) should be.
          The formula for the optimal slope \(m\) is closely
          related to the inner product and is in fact exactly the inner product if \(x\) is a unit vector.
          $$
          m = (x^Tx)^{-1}x^Ty = x^Ty
          $$
          In statistics the inner product \(x^Ty\) is often called the correlation.
          For two arbitrary unit vectors, the correlation varies between 1 and -1.
          A best fit slope of 1 means that \(x^Ty \approx 1 \); the points \((x_i,y_i)\) lie along the line \(y=x\) and \(x\) and \(y\) point in about the same direction.

          A best fit slope of -1 means \(x^Ty \approx -1); the points lie along the line \(y=-x\)
          and the vectors point in opposite directions.
          A best fit slope of 0 means \(x^Ty \approx 0\); the points lie along the line \(y=0\)
          and the vectors \(x\) and \(y\) are orthogonal to each other.  These relationships are illustrated in the figure below

      <div class="txt" style="padding:40px">


          Note: the slope here is chosen to minimize the sum of squares error
          $$
          \sum_i \ |y_i - mx_i|^2
          $$
          which is the vertical distance between the best fit line and the points.
          Because of this for two unit vectors \(x\) and \(y\), the best fit slope
          will always be between 1 and -1.
          We could easily switch the roles of the horizontal and vertical axes.
          In this case, we would end up minimizing the horizontal distance between
          the best fit line and the points.  In this case the slope of the best fit
          line would range from 1 to \(\infty\) and then from \(-\infty\) to -1.
          There is no difference between these two for the intuition we are seeking.
          Additionally, if mentally look for a best fit line depending on the distribution of the
          data we may naturally do one or the other so we should consider both cases.

        <div class="txt" style="padding:40px">
          We can summarize our practical intuition in the following way.


          For unit vectors \(x\) and \(y\),
          if the point cloud lines up with the line \(y=x\), then \(y^Tx \approx 1\).
          If the point cloud lines up with the line \(y=-x\), then \(y^Tx \approx -1\).
          If the point cloud lines up with either the vertical or horizontal axis (the point cloud is
          symmetric) then \(y^Tx \approx 0\) and \(y\) and \(x\) are close to orthogonal.
          This intuition is illustrated below.

        <div class="txt" style="padding:40px">
          Note that in the context of
          data fitting, statistics, and probability, this perspective is quite common.

          For example, it is well known that a multivariate normal distributions for 2D
          vector of the form \((x_i,y_i)\) is symmetric across the axes
          if the \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) elements are independently distributed or uncorrelated, ie.
          \(\sum_i x_iy_i  = x^Ty \approx 0 \) for data samples \(i=1,\dots,n\)
