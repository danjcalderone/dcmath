              <b> MATRIX NORMS </b>
              <p>
                Matrices can be thought of as vector style objects
                (in a vector space) and also as linear operators between vector spaces.
                There are many norm ("size") concepts for matrices in both of these settings.
                When we treat matrices simply as vectors we can apply the standard
                vector norm concepts.  These norms are useful in some settings
                but do not capture the structure of the linear operator the matrix represents.
                Norms that treat matrices as linear operators are called induced norms
                and capture more of the operator structure of the matrix.  We will discuss
                both norm types below, with more of a focus on operator/induced norms.
              </p>



              </p>

              <b> VECTOR-STYLE NORMS </b>
              <p>

                When we think of a matrix as a vector the standard
                \(p\)-norms (1-norm, 2-norm, \(\infty\)-norm, etc.)
                all still apply with their usual definitions. Some of them have
                special names.  Specifically, the Frobenius norm refers to the
                standard vector 2-norm applied to a matrix.
              </p>

              <b> Frobenius Norm </b>

              <p>
              The Frobenius norm of a matrix \( A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n} \) is
              denoted as \( \Vert A \Vert_F\) and
              given by
              $$
              \Vert A \Vert_F = \left(\sum_{ij} (A_{ij})^2\right)^{\tfrac{1}{2}} =
              \left(Tr\big(A^TA\big)\right)^{\tfrac{1}{2}}
              =
              \left(Tr\big(AA^T\big)\right)^{\tfrac{1}{2}}
              $$
              Note that this is the vector 2-norm appllied to \(A\) and that the
              trace formulas on the right are computable for any size \(A\)
              and gives the desired sum (though computing the full matrices \(A^TA\)
              or \(AA^T\) does many extra/unneeded computations).
              </p>
              <b> Frobenius Norm: Relations to SVD (Difficulty: 2) </b>
              <p>
              From properties of traces, we can quickly derive the relationship between
              the Frobenius norm and the singular value decomposition.  Let the SVD of
              \(A\) be given by
              $$
              A = U \begin{bmatrix} \Sigma & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}V^T
              $$
              We can then quickly compute that
              $$
              Tr \big(A^TA\big) = Tr\left(V
              \begin{bmatrix} \Sigma & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}U^T
              U\begin{bmatrix} \Sigma & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}V^T\right)
              $$
              $$
              =
              Tr \left(
              V\begin{bmatrix} \Sigma^2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}V^T
              \right)
              =
              Tr \left(
              \begin{bmatrix} \Sigma^2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}V^TV
              \right)
              = Tr \big(\Sigma^2 \big)
              $$
              Thus we have that the Frobenius norm is also the 2-norm applied to
              a vector of the singular values of a matrix.
              $$
              \Vert A \Vert_F = \left(\sum_{i}(\sigma_i)^2\right)^{\tfrac{1}{2}}
              $$
              The trace definitions above make the Frobenius norm often easy to
              work with algebraically (since matrices commute (cyclically)
              inside the trace operator).
              Often in optimization when we want to minimize the size of a matrix,
              we use the squared Frobenius-norm as an objective function.

            </p>

            <b> INDUCED NORMS </b>
            <p>
              Induced norms, or operator norms, measure how much a matrix
              changes the size of vectors it operates on. To quantify this exactly
              we ask what is the maximum increase in size a matrix can ad
              to a unit vector in the domain.  Note that this implies a notation of
              size, ie. a vector norm both to define a unit vector in the domain
              as well as the size of the output vector in the codomain.  The
              vector norms we pick for the domain or codomain can be the same or
              different.  We often denote an induced norm as \(\Vert A\Vert_{q,p}\)
              where \(p\) refers to the norm type in the domain and \(q\)
              refers to the norm type in the co-domain.  Explicitly, we can use the
              following definitions for an induced norm
              $$
              \Vert A\Vert_{q,p} =
              \max_{\Vert x \Vert_p=1 } \ \Vert Ax \Vert_q
              =
              \max_{\Vert x \Vert_p \neq 0 } \ \frac{\Vert Ax \Vert_q}{\Vert x \Vert_p}
              $$
              In the first definition, we find the \(x\) constrained to the (\(p\)-norm) unit ball,
              that maximizes the size (with respect to the \(q\)-norm) after it is transformed
              by \(A\).  In the second definition, we no longer explicitly require that
              \(x\) is on the unit ball (only that \(x \neq 0\)) since
              we normalize by the length of \(x\) when we do the maximization. Both
              definitions are equivalent and either can be used.  If \(q\) and \(p\) are
              the same, we sometimes use \(\Vert \cdot \Vert_p\) to refer to
              \(\Vert \cdot \Vert_{p,p}\) if the fact we're using an induced norm is
              clear from context.

            </p>

            <b> Induced Norms: Specific Cases (Difficulty: 2) </b>

            <p>
            For several specifc induced norms, we can derive further
            relationships to the structure of the matrix.  The \(2,2\)-norm
            or induced 2-norm is given by the maximum singular value of the matrix
            and the \(1,1\)-norm, \(1,\infty\)-norm, the \(1,\infty\)-norm, and the
            \(\infty,\infty\)-norm all have relationships with the magnitude
            of the rows and columns that I can't remember
